# SythesizedBreathingM-3

## Overview: 
### This project aims to develop a system to generate breathing sounds for medical simulation manikins that can be adjusted based on variables such as demographic factors (i.e. age, gender) and health conditions (i.e. asthma, COPD, pneumonia) to train students to accurately diagnose medical conditions. Ideally, this system will be able to receive input about the state of the patient and location of the stethoscope, and then generate the corresponding breath sound to be transmitted to a bluetooth stethoscope speaker system.
